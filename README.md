# Gem-Quest
My final group project from Game Design

I worked in a team of four for this project created in Game Maker. The group worked on this for about a month. I was responsible for delegating responsibilities to the other members, and I contributed a large portion of the code(GML). I created the text box and HUD system for this game as well, including a script for talking with the NPCs using those text boxes. All sprites and sounds were created for this project. None were found online. I helped create the sound effects and about half of the sprites. I was fully in charge of level design and the plot of the game.
